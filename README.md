# Project Management App - 355 Project

Welcome to Project Management App. Our aim for this app is to help project teams connect with each other bringing features from apps like Wunderlist, GroupMe and Calendar all in one place.

This is the "Client" side of the app. You will need to connect this app to the server to access all the information, which is stored in a database. To run the app, please use the README of "Server" app and follow the instructions.


## Instructions to run the Client

2. Now, change the IP Address in the variable "ipa" in the following files: "Chat.java", "Home.java", "Cal.java". This will make the connection to the server.
